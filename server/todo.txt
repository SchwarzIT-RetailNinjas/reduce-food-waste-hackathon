Main Use Case: Send events about discounted products
Technology: Spring boot or NodeJS

1. Server should be able to receive request for posting a discount

e.g: [POST] /discounts
{
    storeID: "",
    products: "one or more products",
    end_of_discounts: timestampt
}

?: Where do the events come from?
- We can make a simulation (postman automated requests)

2. Server analyzes type of products for sending in specials channels
e.g: products: [ "cheese", "table" ] => [ "food", "furniture" ]

2. Server can then emit the message to a certain channels of redis
e.g:
- Name of channels: FrankfurtAmMainStore-all (all stands for all products   
                    FrankfurtAmMainStore-food (only the food)
